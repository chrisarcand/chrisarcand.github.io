I'm a Principal Engineer at [IBM / HashiCorp][1]{:target="\_blank"} where I work on
[Terraform][2]{:target="\_blank"}, an [IaC][12]{:target="\_blank"} industry-defining tool for
managing any kind of service by codifying APIs into declarative configuration files. I call the
[Twin Cities][7]{:target="\_blank"} of [Minneapolis][8]{:target="\_blank"} and [St.
Paul][9]{:target="\_blank"}, [Minnesota][10]{:target="\_blank"} my home.

I'm a big advocate of distributed teams and open source, having spent the majority of my career as a
100% remote employee and at other top tier open source companies such as [Red
Hat][3]{:target="\_blank"}. As a public speaker I've had the privilege of speaking at major
conferences as close as the American Midwest and as far as Kyoto, Japan on topics in my
areas of expertise: Golang, Ruby, and Cloud Infrastructure, among others.

Outside of programming I love ice hockey. I devote a lot of my time organizing amateur hockey groups
such as the Dangling Pointers™ - Minnesota's premier shitty beer league hockey team - and as a USA
Hockey certified coach for the White Bear Lake Area Hockey Association for my kids. Still, I make
sure to reserve enough time to fulfill my responsibility as a native Minnesotan to making pointless
connections to Minnesota at every opportunity.
