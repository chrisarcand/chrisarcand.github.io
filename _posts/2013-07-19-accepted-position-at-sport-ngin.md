I'm thrilled to announce that I've just accepted a position at <a href="http://sportngin.com">Sport Ngin</a> as a software engineer on their development team. I'll be working with some really exciting web technologies and building a new client-side Node.js application from the ground up.

Sport Ngin, an established and successful business since 2008 and recently voted 1 of Minnesota's Top 100 Companies to work for, brings web-based SaaS offerings to the sports world.

Everyone I've met at Sport Ngin throughout my interview process has been fantastic and I'm really excited to get started in August.
