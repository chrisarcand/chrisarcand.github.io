World renowned neurologist and author Oliver Sacks died yesterday.

> Oliver Sacks, the neurologist and acclaimed author who explored some of the brain’s strangest pathways in best-selling
> case histories like “The Man Who Mistook His Wife for a Hat,” using his patients’ disorders as starting points for
> eloquent meditations on consciousness and the human condition, died on Sunday at his home in Manhattan. He was 82.

["Oliver Sacks, doctor of ‘Awakenings’ and poet laureate of medicine, dies at 82" by the New York Times][1]

If you haven't read [_Musicophilia: Tales of Music and the Brain_][2] you need to go pick up a copy. Right now. It's
amazing.

> In _Musicophilia_, he examines the powers of music through the individual experiences of patients, musicians, and
> everyday people. Among them: a surgeon who is struck by lightning and suddenly becomes obsessed with Chopin; people
> who "amusia", to whom a symphony sounds like the clattering of pots and pans; and a man whose memory spans only seven
> seconds - for everything but music. Dr. Sacks describes how music can animate people with Parkinson's disease who
> cannot otherwise move, give words to stroke patients who cannot otherwise speak, and calm and organize people who are
> deeply disoriented by Alzheimer's or schizophrenia.
