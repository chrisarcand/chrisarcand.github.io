My wife Emily was accepted into the [PA program][1] at [George Washington University][2]
in Washington, D.C. - and we're excited to say that she has accepted and we'll be relocating
out east towards the end of April!

Leaving home is hard in some ways, and [very easy in others][3]. 
This is a life-changing opportunity for Emily and we're eager to start something new and experience life outside
of the Twin Cities for a while. I've always liked the East Coast and I'm pretty pumped to be able to stay there
for a longer period of time.

I'm also happy to say that I'll be continuing to work for [Sport Ngin](http://www.sportngin.com) remotely,
visiting our office in Minneapolis throughout the year. I've received a ton of support from my colleagues
and am thrilled to be able to continue building out the platform and working with an awesome group of developers.

Added bonus: [now I can watch the Wild][5] and the entire NHL (excluding the Capitals)
for a [fraction of the cost that I'm currently paying][4]. Up yours, Comcast!
