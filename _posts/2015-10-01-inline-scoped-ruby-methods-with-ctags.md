**TLDR: You can use [this](#solution) in your .ctags file to parse method definitions like
`private def method_name` in Ruby 2.1+**

Starting in Ruby 2.1, [defining a method returns the name of the method as a symbol][1], not just
`nil`. This was frequently suggested to be able to take advantage of fact that module methods like
`public`, `private` and `protected` can accept a symbol as an argument, allowing for the following
elegant-looking (or at least more commonly seen in other languages like C# or Java) code:

```ruby
protected def some_protected_method
  # ...
end

private def some_private_method
  # ...
end
```

At [Sport Ngin][4] we've been using a more explicit convention in declaring a method private after each
and every private method definition for some time:

```ruby
def some_private_method
  # ...
end
private :some_private_method
```

There are many arguments for and against this and I won't go over it here. I personally prefer
the format you most commonly see with `private` and all of the private methods at the bottom of your
class, but I do think that the new syntax that Ruby 2.1+ allows is better than `private
:method_name` declarations - it's easier to see and saves a line every definition with less clutter.

We've since [changed our styleguide to use this new syntax][2], which I've started to call 'inline scoped
methods'.

## New syntax, old Ctags

I don't use [Ctags][5] for everything. With vim I usually navigate a project with various keybindings to
[CtrlP][6] and [The Silver Searcher][7] with combinations of grep/awk. What I do use frequently is CtrlP's
`CtrlPBufTag` command, which uses Ctags on the fly to jump to methods in the file you have open:

![A demo of CtrlPBufTag](../images/posts/ctags_ctrlp_example.gif)

But Ctags, [having last been updated in July 2009][8], doesn't recognize this new inline scoped method
syntax. I dug in to figure out how to add this functionality. It turns out that adding options
and new parsings for Ctags is as simple as editing (or creating) `~/.ctags`

## The Solution

It took me a bit as I'm _very_ unfamiliar with POSIX regular expressions, but the following addition
I wrote seems to work well:

```
--regex-ruby=/(^|;)[ \t]*(private|protected|public)(_class_method)?\(? def *(self.)?([[:alnum:]_]+)/\5/f,inline scoped method,inline scoped methods (Ruby 2.1+)/
```

This will match inline scoped definitions for private, protected, and public instance methods as
well as private class methods.

![Now CtrlP works with the new syntax](../images/posts/inline_scoped_method_example.jpg)


Even if you don't plan on using the new syntax afforded by Ruby 2.1+, I suggest that if you use
Ctags you add this functionality as if other people _do_ use it, you suddenly won't be able to
find these sorts of methods at all.

Misc:

* In digging into this issue I learned a ton about Ctags and what you can do with them. I consider
  myself fairly skilled at navigating a project quickly using the text searching tools mentioned
  earlier, but I certainly plan to dig in to Ctags more. They seem to have unlimited potential as a
  fully fledged project navigation tool. People who navigate _very_ large projects all the time seem
  to enjoy them...

* I also found a bunch of [other useful additions to Ctags][3], specifically for Rails developers.

* Lastly, I discovered a maintained successor to the original Exuberant Ctags, [Universal Ctags][9].
  As of this writing, I don't believe functionality for the syntax in this post has been added.
