My colleague Brady Ouren recently posted about a pattern we developed to more easily test user permissions in Rails controllers
with RSpec. It's especially useful when a ton of different things need to be mocked to set up the proper conditions for a successful
test.

It works out quite well; my only complaint is that using such methods throws off such things as `vim-rspec`.
