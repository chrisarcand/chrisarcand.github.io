If you don’t know much about GraphQL, you probably just identify it as the hip,
shiny new thing companies are adopting to replace their RESTful APIs. Sure,
sure – clients can ask for only what they need in a single request – but is

introduced to GraphQL beyond just the usual explanations of the query language
and learn why things like GraphQL’s introspection and type system make it an
enormous advancement in web technologies.
